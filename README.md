# Dropzone Multi File Uploader for Concrete5 v5.6

The Concrete5 Legacy multi file uploader requires flash which is no longer enabled by default in most browsers. This is a set of core file overrides which will replace the flash based uploader with Dropzone allowing for multi file uploads without the flash browser requirement.
